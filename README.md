Since polybar for rainmeter has been out of dev for a few years and is no longer responding to pull requests, I decided to make a fork. Slowly I'll be updating things as I come across my own needs. Eventually, adding new themes and functionality. 

**Backlog**
- [ ] Fix apps appearing on taskbar.
- [ ] Fix modules
- [ ] Fix applauncher
- [ ] Modernize themeing
- [ ] Rounded corners

This skin contain many themes which have totally unique looks and design. In each theme contains many modules and some of them have never-seen before functionality. Explore them yourself and help me expand more.
